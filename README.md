# Inventory-Management

Welcome to Inventory-Management, a powerful full-stack desktop application that seamlessly connects user views, back-end functionality, and MySQL database support.

Built using Maven, this application efficiently handles all dependencies, ensuring a smooth development experience.

With Java FXML powering the dynamic front-end and a well-structured MVC architecture, Inventory-Management offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionality.

To get started, simply download the application from the GitHub repository linked below. The repository also includes the necessary MySQL script to set up the database support for the application.

Before running the application, ensure you have Java 17 and MySQL installed on your computer. You can find the required downloads online.

To set up the database, follow these steps:

1. Run `Mysql_run_once.txt` in your MySQL editor.
2. Run `Mysql_script_set_reset` once to initialize the database.
3. For future resets, run `Mysql_script_set_reset` whenever you need to restore the database to its initial state.
