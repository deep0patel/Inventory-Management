# Inventory-Management

It's a powerful full-stack desktop application that seamlessly connects user views, back-end functionality, and MySQL database support.

I built this project to help the employer of my friend to help them with their inventory mangement. It can mangage all the products in inventory and can also print a report at the end of the day. It has user management and authentication functionality. With Java FXML powering the dynamic front-end and a well-structured MVC architecture, Inventory-Management offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionality.

To get started, simply download the application from the GitHub repository linked below. The repository also includes the necessary MySQL script to set up the database support for the application.

Before running the application, ensure you have Java 17 and MySQL installed on your computer. You can find the required downloads online.

To set up the database, follow these steps:

1. Run `Mysql_run_once.txt` in your MySQL editor.
2. Run `Mysql_script_set_reset` once to initialize the database.
3. For future resets, run `Mysql_script_set_reset` whenever you need to restore the database to its initial state.
